            <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
            <li>2 pounds elbow macaroni</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons butter, divided</li>           
            <li>2 cups whole milk, or as needed</li>            
            <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>            
            <li>2 pounds shredded sharp Cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>1/2 cup seasoned breadcrumbs (optional)</li>
            <li>16 ounces sharp Cheddar cheese, cubed</li>
            <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>24 ounces extra-sharp yellow Cheddar cheese, cubed</li>
            </div>
        </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grease a large casserole dish. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Add milk, bring to a simmer, then reduce heat to low. Mix flour with 2 to 3 tablespoons water until smooth.  Add flour mixture to the saucepan, stirring constantly, and cook until sauce thickens. Add cubed extra-sharp Cheddar and cubed sharp Cheddar cheese, stirring until cheese melts. Remove from heat. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil, and cook elbow macaroni until al dente (tender with a bite), about 8 minutes, or according to package instructions. Drain and set aside.  
            </li>
            <li>
                Melt remaining 2 tablespoons butter in a microwave-safe bowl on High, about 10 seconds. In a large bowl, combine elbow macaroni, melted  butter, and eggs. Stir in cheese sauce; adding a little more milk if the sauce seems too thick. Season with salt and pepper.
            </li>
            <li>
                Pour macaroni and cheese into the prepared casserole dish. Top with shredded cheese and seasoned breadcrumbs. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake in the preheated oven until <strong>golden brown</strong> bubbling, 35 to 45 minutes. 
            </li>
        </ol>
